## Welcome to my personal site!

Hi! My name is Sophie and for my first post, I just wanted to include a short introduction. I am in my third year of undergrad at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, CA, where I am obtaining my degree in Political Science, with a concentration in Quantitative Political Science. My minors are statistics and Spanish, because I want to reinforce my learning of quantitative methods/data analysis with stats, and because I want to learn Spanish!

In my free time, I like to read, do crosswords, hang out with my roommates, run, embroider, tend my houseplants, and hike. The picture on this post is from a sunrise hike I did last summer at Mt. Tallac in South Lake Tahoe! 

Once I finish my degree, I plan to leave San Luis Obispo and move to a city on the East Coast to work for a year or two before going back to get my Masters. I am currently starting to think about what I want to do when I graduate, and since I know I like working with data and public policy, I am working on learning R, taking some econ courses, and starting my senior project (I will make a separate page on this site with updates on my senior project!). 

I currently am working as a Teaching Assistant in the course Data Analysis for Political Science. I work with my professor to design the course to help political science students learn the basics of data analysis and quantitative methods, and I am also in charge of creating all the labs to teach students R for the first time. In addition, I am enrolled in the course Statistical Programming with R, in which course I am learning even more about using R for statistics, including data cleaning, visualization, wrangling, and more! I am really excited to keep learning R because it has been so fun thus far.
