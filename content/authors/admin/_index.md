I am a student of Political Science at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. My concentration is in Quantitative Political Science and I am minoring in Statistics and Spanish. 

My hobbies include reading, running, crosswords, tending to my houseplants, and spending too much time on Twitter.
